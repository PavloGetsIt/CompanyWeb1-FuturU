                    <p class="aboutBody">By repeatedly listening and or watching memories from your past or with new media, 
                        you slowly begin to ingrain a new mindset and believe system. The images,
                        words and music subconsiously and unconsiously convince into a new way
                        of thinking. Inturn, the pain threshold for taking action is lowered, and
                        taking action towards goals that previously caused immense anxiety, are now
                        more managable.

                <div class="aboutHeader">How will this help me?</div>
                    <p class="aboutBody"> In the 21st century people grow and mature amidst
                        an environment and world that is not very conducive to accomplishing personal goals
                        that require devote attention. Whether the goals are involved with a persons
                        health, relationships, mindset or money, in a distracted world, it is a long
                        slow rollercoaster of a battle. But we can change this by creating our own
                        environments that force us into mindsets that prevent us from being distracted and
                        rather already convinced that we will accomplish our goals.

                <div class="aboutHeader">This is crazy?! How could this work?</div>
                    <p class="aboutBody">
                        It works the same way everyone has acquired their current mindset and belives;
                        through their environment. Within 1-3 months of listening or watching a minimum
                        of 2 times daily you will begin to act, associate with and live in a way that is
                        tailored to your goals. It requires as much willpower as pressing a single button
                        and I certainly believe have enough energy to do that. Throughout the process, you
                        will find out a lot about your life and what is bringing you up and down.

            <div class="aboutFour">
                <div class="aboutHeader">What option is better, Affirmation or Mindmovie?</div>
                <p class="aboutBody">
                    Mind movies do a much better job of spiking your emotions because you're able
                    to replay the scenes in your mind as yourself. Think superhero movies. Now you're
                    the hero. But affirmations are just as effective if you're the type to just leave 
                    the audio playing in the background. Your mind doesn't need direct focus towards either,
                    but it certainly helps you memorize each affirmation if you set a time during the day
                    to sit and listen or watch.
